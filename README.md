# Prediction Markets Research

This repository is a **research lab for identifying structural and arbitrage-based edges** in prediction markets.

The focus is on building a **clean, reusable framework** for observing markets, detecting inconsistencies, and testing strategies before risking capital.  
It currently targets **polymarket**, with room to expand to other venues.
